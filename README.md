# **Reinventing The Wheel**

## **A project coded by Lukas, Matty, and pluto**
<!--- Names are in alphabetical order. --->
<!--- Yes, I prefer my name (pluto) without any capitals. --->
<!--- Also, yes, I partially learned markdown just for github. --->

### **What is this project about?**

---

### The goal of this project is)

---
To create a NuGet package that other developers may use to help them complete difficult tasks that involve:

- Arrays... what I need... in my pay...
- Strings... with ridiculous memes... and markup...
- And math... lots of math... I can't add up how many times I had to fix a math related thing here...

---

## **What Functions are covered?**

---

### There are many functions for each arrays, strings and math

---

Here is a list of the functions that we will be replicating(As these functions already exist).
<!--- "Additional Method 1, 2, 3 & 4" are all placeholders until we decide what function we will make/ replicate.
        When that is decided, I can replace it with a description of whatever we make. --->
