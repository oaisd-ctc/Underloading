### **What is this project about?**
<br>

The goal of this project is:
<br>
To create a NuGet package that other developers may use to help them complete difficult tasks that involve:
- Arrays
- Strings
- And math.

<hr>

## **What Functions are covered?**
<hr>

There will be many functions for each arrays, strings and math.
<br>

Here is a list of the functions that we will be replicating(As these functions already exist).
<!--- "Additional Method 1, 2, 3 & 4" are all placeholders until we decide what function we will make/ replicate.
        When that is decided, I can replace it with a description of whatever we make. --->
